Codes developed in order to demonstrate basic knowledge in Data Structure (JAVA)

It uses concepts such as:

- Arrays and ArrayLists: Data structures for storing elements sequentially.

- Linked Lists: Data structures where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node.

- Stacks: Last In First Out (LIFO) data structures, where the last element added is the first to be removed.

- Queues: First In First Out (FIFO) data structures, where the first element added is the first to be removed.

- Trees: Hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a main node called the root.
